# PageRank
A project on Personalized PageRank: computation, applications, strategic links, for Complex Networks course. 

The files are as follows:

1. A PageRank Game - A step-by-step tutorial showing the implementation steps in our section on manipulating PageRank, where we used optimal linking strategies to add links in the network and increase the PageRank of our target node. This is a Python Implementation.

2. Comparing Basic Implementation Methods - Shows how we implemented PageRank algorithms using an Iterative method and a Monte Carlo method. This is a Python Implementation.

3. Implementing FAST-PPR - Shows our attempt at implementating the FAST-PPR approach, with pictures from the original paper denoting how the algorithm should be setup. This is still a work in progress - we need to further investigate if there is a bug in our code, or if the parameter settings are causing the issues. This is a Python Implementation.

4. sink_rank - Shows an example of a network with a Sink Rank, constructed using Matlab.

5. pagerank_notepad.pdf - A step-by-step tutorial showing how ApproximatePR was implemented for our report, using Matlab.
